        <h1><u>Ectomorphs</u></h1><br>
        <h4>An ectopmorph has a lean body type. This ususally consists of having very little body fat but also very little msucle. They
            have a hard time gaining weight and storing fat. Thye have narrow-chested chest frames and have a hard time bulking up and putting 
            on weight and muscle. Both males and females alike tend to have narrow shoudlers and hips, and typically have fast metabolisms. For males,
            it is also found that this body type has lower testerone levels than other body types. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h2><u>Fitness Tips</u></h2><br>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom:5vh">Since Ectomorphs have a hard time gaining weight, it is advised to avoid cardiovascular workouts such as running and biking
            if one has the goal of building up muscle and weight. Since cardiovascular exercises expend more energy, they burn more calories and
            so ectomorphs who already can burn fat quicker than most, should focus on workouts where the amount of weight lifted is prioritized
            in place of high energy expendeture workouts. Ectomorphs can also take supplements, such as mass gainer, to help with gaining
            muscle and mass faster. As a reudlt of a higher metabolism combined with working out ectomorphs should eat a higher caloric diet as they tend to 
            burn these faster and need to replenish more often. Below is an image of some of the foods ectopmorphs should make apart of their diet.

        <ul>

        <h1><u>Endomorphs</u></h1><br>
        <h4>The body type of endomorphs are typically opposite of ectomorphs. They have larger bone structures, and tend to gain
            fat faster and have a harder time losing it. Hence, they tend to carry more fat around and have a stockier frame than 
            ectomorphs, with larger midsections and hips. They can however gain muscle faster than other body types and gain weight without
            much difficulty. Compared to ectomorphs they have slower metabolisms and should be cautious of this as it can lead to health
            problems. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h2><u>Fitness Tips</u></h2><br>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom:5vh">Compared to ectomorphs, who do not need to worry as much about caloric intake, endomorphs
        should prioritize limiting calories and eating more high protein diets. Proteins should foods such as salmon, turkey or
        other lean meats. Endomorphs should focuse on anaeorbic cardio and resistance training. Incorporating cardio will help this body 
        type burn calories and fat, something that is harder for endomorphs. Interval workouts are also highly encouraged by mixing
        high-intensity workouts with rest period in between. Studies have shown this will help burn more fat during a workout. Endomorphs 
        also should avoid processed foods at costs as these empty calories will hinder progress in the weigh losss department and
        should strive for a clean diet. Endomorphs should aim for 1.5 grams of protein per pond of body weight, while limiting unnecessary 
        calories. Below is an image of some of the foods endopmorphs should make apart of their diet.</h5><br>

        <h1><u>Mesomorphs</u></h1><br>
        <h4> The body type of mesomorphs tend to be somewhere in the middle of those of endomorphs and ectomorphs. They have medium bone
            structures, witht he shoulders being a little bit wider than the hips. They can both gain weight and muscles with relative 
            ease, as well as losing fat and muscle. They tnd to have athletic and strong body frames. Their metabolism also tends to be very 
            well as they can eat without as much worry as an endomorph. Their weight also tends to be evenly distributed through their body, so
            no one area typically stands out. <br><br><br><br>

        <h2><u>Fitness Tips</u></h2>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom:5vh">Mesomorphs tend to have an athletic build and a well-balanced body composition. Mesomorphs have
        a wide array of exercises and workouts they can do and can get results faster than most. HIIT, High-intensity interval training, is 
        one way mesomorphs can maintain that atheletic build while building more muscle at the same time. Mesomorphs are the ideal standard
        for body types and with the right training and diet, both ectomotphs and endomorphs can transform their bodies to this body type.
        Mesomorphs should have a healthy balance of both caloric and protein intake. A balanced diet, such as 30% protein, 30% fat and 40% 
        carbohydrate, is one mesomorphs can adopt to keep their workout performance consistent, while also gettin the results they are aiming
        for. Below is an image of some of the foods mesomorphs should make apart of their diet.</h5><br><br><br><br>
